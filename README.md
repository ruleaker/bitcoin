Based on OKX API automate get the price of Bitcoin  
Code in 1 minute just for not to open Tradingview Everytime when I play League.. XXXD  
Much more convenient when gaming just open CMD and type "python bitcoin.py"   
then just use ALT + TAB for getting the current price, and ready to go back to the Game..LOL
