Based on OKX API automate get the price of Bitcoin
Code in 1 minute just for not to open Tradingview Everytime when I play League..XD
Much more convenient when gaming just open CMD and type "python bitcoin.py" 
then just use ALT + TAB for getting the current price, and ready to go back in the Game..LOL
